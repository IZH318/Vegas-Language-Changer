A utility to easily change the UI language of VEGAS Pro and VEGAS Movie Studio. <br> <br>
Instead of the complex process of manually editing the registry, you can instantly switch to your desired language with just a few clicks through an intuitive graphical interface.

<br>

## üåü Key Features
-   **Automatic Version Detection**: Automatically scans for and lists installed versions of **VEGAS Pro (v9.0 ~ v23.0)** and **Movie Studio (v8.0 ~ v17.0)**.
-   **Batch Language Change**: Select multiple VEGAS versions to change their language all at once.
-   **Intelligent Language Filtering**: The dropdown menu only shows languages commonly supported by all selected versions, preventing incompatible language settings.
-   **Safe Registry Backup**: Before changing the language, your current registry settings are automatically backed up to a `.reg` file on your desktop, allowing for easy restoration.
-   **Automatic Plugin Cache Clearing**: Deletes relevant cache files to prevent language mixing issues that can occur after a language change.
-   **Automatic Language File Restoration**: If a specific language file (`.cfg`) is missing in VEGAS Pro 14 or later, the program automatically copies a built-in file to the VEGAS installation path to ensure a complete language change.
-   **Multilingual UI Support**: The program's UI is automatically localized by detecting the system language. (Supports 10 languages, including English, Korean, Japanese, Chinese, and German)
-   **Automatic Administrator Privilege Request**: Displays a UAC (User Account Control) prompt upon execution to request the necessary administrator privileges for registry modification.

<br>

## üìã Requirements
- **Operating System**: **Windows XP SP3** or later
- **Framework**: **.NET Framework 4.0** or later
  - *Comes pre-installed on Windows 8, 10, and 11. Users on Windows XP or 7 may need to install it.* ‚ûú .NET Framework 4.0 [**Download**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17851)

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Environment
This project was developed and built based on the following environment.
-   **Operating System (OS):** Windows 10 Pro (64-bit)
-   **IDE:** Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 (v142)
-   **Required Workload:** .NET desktop development (Windows Forms)
-   **Target Framework:** .NET Framework 4.0
-   **Language:** C#

<br>

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Deep Dive
This program uses C# and Windows Forms (.NET Framework 4.0) to safely and reliably change the language settings of the VEGAS product family in a Windows environment, utilizing the following core technologies.

### 1. Registry Scanning and Control
-   **Scan Target**: Scans are centered around the `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE` key. To detect 32-bit VEGAS versions on 64-bit Windows, it queries both `RegistryView.Registry64` and `RegistryView.Registry32`, which covers the 32-bit registry path (`Wow6432Node`).
-   **Core Key**: The language setting for each VEGAS version is determined by the `ULangID` (REG_DWORD) value in the following path. The program uses the `Microsoft.Win32.RegistryKey` class to change this value to the LCID (Locale ID) of the target language.
    ```
    HKLM\SOFTWARE\{Vendor}\{Product}\{Version}\Lang
    ```
    -   `{Vendor}`: `Sony Creative Software`, `MAGIX`, `VEGAS Creative Software`, etc.
    -   `{Product}`: `Vegas Pro`, `Movie Studio Platinum`, etc.

### 2. Safety Features
-   **Registry Backup**: Uses `System.Text.StringBuilder` to format the target `ULangID` values into the standard `.reg` file format, then saves it to the desktop as `Vegas_RegBackup_{timestamp}.reg` using `File.WriteAllText`. The file is saved with `Encoding.Unicode` for compatibility with the Windows Registry Editor.
-   **Plugin Cache Cleanup**: To resolve issues where some plugin windows might still appear in the previous language, the program gets the `%LOCALAPPDATA%` path using `Environment.GetFolderPath` and automatically deletes the cache files for each version (`plugin_manager_cache.bin`, `svfx_plugin_cache.bin`) using `File.Delete`. When VEGAS restarts, these files are cleanly regenerated according to the new language settings.

### 3. Language File (`.cfg`) Restoration Mechanism
Starting with VEGAS Pro 14.0, a complete language switch requires not only the `ULangID` registry value but also the corresponding `.cfg` file in the `Language` directory within the installation folder. This program solves this by embedding the necessary `.cfg` files as **Embedded Resources**.

1.  **Resource Access**: The `System.Reflection.Assembly.GetManifestResourceStream()` method is used to get the data stream of the `.cfg` file embedded within the `.exe` executable.
2.  **Path Discovery and Copying**: It checks for the existence of a `Language` or `language` folder based on the `InstallPath` read from the registry.
3.  **Conditional Copy**: Only if the target language's `.cfg` file (e.g., `local_ko_KR.cfg`) does not exist in the destination folder, the embedded resource is copied to a physical file using `Stream.CopyTo` and a `FileStream`.

<br>

## üìã Supported Languages by Version
This program supports a wide range of VEGAS products. <br>

The table below lists the officially supported languages for each version, all of which can be switched using the Vegas Language Changer.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note on Language Changes**
>
> Even when using this tool, some VEGAS versions may not apply certain languages (especially **Polish** and **Russian**) perfectly. This issue is caused by missing or incomplete language resource files within the VEGAS program itself.
>
> Therefore, while this tool correctly performs all necessary steps to change the language, the final display result may vary depending on your VEGAS installation environment.

## üìÑ Embedded `.cfg` File Creation Policy
Some recent versions of VEGAS do not officially provide `.cfg` files for certain languages. The files embedded in this program were created for user convenience according to the following strict and consistent principles.

### **Standard Operating Procedure**
1.  **Base Setting:** The English (`en_US`) configuration file from the **latest version** being targeted was used as the **`Base`**. This ensured that all items and the structure of the latest version were preserved.
2.  **Reference Setting:** The target language configuration file from a **previous version** was used as the **`Reference`** to obtain unique links and information for that language.
3.  **Selective Merge:** The `Base` file was overwritten with values from the `Reference` file, but with the following **key exceptions** strictly applied:
    *   The **`phash` value was always kept from the latest `Base` file**.
    *   New items not present in the `Reference` file (e.g., the `[GettingStarted]` section) were preserved as they were in the `Base` file.

### Language File Creation Details by Version
